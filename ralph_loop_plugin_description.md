Ralph Loop for Antigravity
A VSCode extension that brings the Ralph Loop autonomous AI agent methodology to Antigravity.

Overview
Developers using AI coding assistants face two key challenges:

Context window limitations - LLMs forget important context mid-task
Constant oversight required - AI cannot work autonomously for extended periods
The Ralph Loop methodology solves this by externalizing memory to files and running AI agents in iterative loops. This extension provides intuitive controls for managing these loops directly within VS Code.

Quick Start
Install the extension from the VSIX file
Create your PRD/spec file (see Task File Format below)
Use Planning mode in Antigravity to help create a proper PRD with discrete tasks
Open the Ralph Loop sidebar via the Activity Bar icon
Configure your session in the sidebar:
Select task file (default: PRD.md)
Set progress file (default: progress.txt)
Choose mode and model
Set max iterations
Start the loop using the play button in the sidebar
Recommended Workflow (Antigravity):
Use Planning mode to create your PRD/spec file with well-defined tasks.
Then switch to Fast mode to run the Ralph Loop for execution.

File Structure
The extension uses a simple file-based architecture:

File	Purpose	Description
PRD.md	Task Specification	Your tasks/requirements. Read-only for agent.
progress.txt	Progress Log	Agent appends progress here. Source of truth for completion.
prompt.md	Instructions	Optional custom instructions for the agent.
Task File Format
The task file is read-only - the agent never modifies it. Write a proper PRD or specification document, but organize it into discrete, actionable tasks so the agent can identify what to work on next by cross-referencing progress.txt.

# PRD: User Management System

## Overview
Build a user management system with authentication, profiles, and admin controls.

## Task 1: Authentication
Implement JWT-based authentication with login/logout endpoints.
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- Token refresh mechanism

## Task 2: User Profiles
Create user profile CRUD operations.
- GET/PUT /api/users/:id
- Profile picture upload
- Email verification

## Task 3: Admin Dashboard
Build admin interface for user management.
- List all users with pagination
- Suspend/activate accounts
- View user activity logs

The key is clear task boundaries - each ## Task N: section should be a self-contained unit of work that the agent can complete in one iteration.

Progress File Format
The agent appends entries to track completion. This is how it knows which tasks are done:

[2026-01-21 10:30] Started: Task 1 - User Authentication
[2026-01-21 10:45] Created auth module in src/auth/
[2026-01-21 11:00] Completed: Task 1 - User Authentication
[2026-01-21 11:05] Started: Task 2 - Database Migrations

Features
Activity Bar & Sidebar
Ralph Loop has a dedicated Activity Bar icon. The sidebar shows:

Session: Current status, mode, model, iteration count, elapsed time
Configuration: All configurable options (click to change)
Mode (Fast/Planning)
Model
Max Iterations
Prompt File
Task File
Progress File
Status Bar
A persistent status bar item displays:

Loop state: Running, Paused, or Stopped
Current iteration: 15/50
Elapsed time: 2m 34s
Output Channel
The Ralph Loop output channel provides:

Streaming agent responses
Iteration markers and phase tracking
Progress indicators
Commands
Command	Description
Ralph: Start Ralph Loop	Start a new loop session
Ralph: Stop Ralph Loop	Stop the loop gracefully
Ralph: Pause/Resume Ralph Loop	Toggle pause state
Ralph: Emergency Stop Ralph Loop	Immediately stop the loop
Configuration
Settings
Configure Ralph Loop via VS Code Settings (Preferences: Open Settings):

Setting	Default	Description
ralphLoop.maxIterations	50	Maximum iterations per loop
ralphLoop.defaultMode	Fast	Default mode
ralphLoop.defaultModel	Gemini 3 Flash	Default AI model
ralphLoop.promptFile	None	Default prompt file
ralphLoop.taskFile	PRD.md	Default task file
ralphLoop.progressFile	progress.txt	Default progress file
How It Works
Fresh Context Per Iteration: Each iteration spawns a fresh cascade session, sending structured instructions that reference your task and progress files.

Structured Instructions: The agent receives clear instructions:

Read tasks from your task file
Check progress in your progress file
Complete exactly one task
Append progress (never delete)
Commit changes
File-Based Memory: Progress persists on disk between iterations in progress.txt, not in the agent's memory.

Graceful Stop: The stop command waits for the current iteration to complete.

Emergency Stop: Immediately terminates the loop.

Automatic Loop Completion
When you start a loop, Ralph generates a unique completion marker (e.g., ralph-done-a3x9k). The agent is instructed to append this marker to the progress file when ALL tasks are complete.

Before each iteration, Ralph checks the last few lines of your progress file for this marker. If found, the loop ends automatically - no manual stop needed.

This means:

The loop stops on its own when work is done
Each loop session has a unique marker (prevents false positives from old runs)
You can still manually stop anytime if needed
Troubleshooting
"No task file selected"
Select a task file in the sidebar Configuration section.

"No workspace folder open"
Open a folder in VS Code before starting Ralph Loop.

Loop not responding
Use Ralph: Emergency Stop Ralph Loop from the Command Palette.

Wrong workspace
The extension opens your task/prompt file before starting to ensure the agent works in the correct workspace.
